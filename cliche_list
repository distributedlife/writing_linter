As honest as the day is long
As horny as a three balled tomcat
As if!
As luck would have it
As many Chins as a Chinese phone book
As plain as the nose on your face
As snug as a bug in a rug
As tender as a mother's heart
As the crow flies
As useful as a lead balloon
As useful as tits on a bull
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party
As ye sow, so shall ye reap
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies
Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country

Ill-fated idea
In a wink

Is a pig pork?
Is it soup yet?
Is the Pope Catholic?
Isn't all it's cracked up to be
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It ain't rocket science
It all comes out in the wash
It is good to be king
It takes two to tango
It will do
It won't fly
It's a game of inches
It's a lemon
It's a wash
It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye.
It's all over but the crying
It's better than a sharp stick in the eye
It's business
It's in the bag
It's never too late to learn
It's not a sprint, it's a marathon
It's not over till it's over
It's not the size of the dog in the fight.  It's the size of the fight in the dog.
It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game
It's raining like a cow pissing on a flat rock
It's what's on the inside that counts

Waiting for the dust to settle
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
Waiting for your ship to come in
Waiting with baited breath

Were you born in a barn?
Were you raised by wolves?
Wet behind the ears
Wet blanket
Wet dream
Wham, bam, thank you mam
What a blast
What a duck!
What a square
What a tangled web we weave
What a way to go
What a Zoo
What am I, chopped liver?
What are you stewing about?
What are you? Chicken?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
What goes around comes around
What goes up, must come down
What in tarnation?
What on earth is wrong with me?
What rock did you crawl out from under?
What you see is what you get
What you see, is what you get
What's cookin' good lookin'?
What's going down?
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
What's he been smoking?
What's that got to do with the price of eggs in Chicago
What's up with that?
What's up?!
What's wrong with this picture?
Whatever floats your boat
Whatever tickles your fancy
Whatever turns you on
Wheel is turning but the hamster is dead
When all is said and done
When hell freezes over
When in Rome, do as Romans do
When it rains, it pours
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
When pigs fly
When push comes to shove
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When you lie with dogs, you catch fleas
Where there's smoke there's fire
Where's the Beef?
Whistling in the dark
White elephant gift
White knuckle ride
Who died and left you in charge?
Who's the man?
Whole nine yards
Whole shootin' match
Whoop it up
Why buy the cow when the milk is free?
Why close the barn door after the horse is gone?
Why on God's green Earth?

You can say that again
You can take that to the bank
You can't fit a square peg in a round hole
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube
You can't stop him. You can only hope to contain him.
You can't swing a dead cat
You can't take knickers off a bare arse
You cannot judge someone until you have walked a mile in their
You cannot judge someone until you have walked a mile in their
You could have knocked me over with a feather
You don't have a leg to stand on
You don't miss the water till the well runs dry
You got it coming to you
You got your just desserts
You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette
You lost me
You make a better door than a window
You make your bed, and then you have to lay in it
You make your bed, and then you have to sleep in it
You must crawl before you can walk
You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours
You snooze, you loose
You're a good egg
You're going to get it
You've got more front than Myers
You've got nerve
You've the nerve
Young loins
Young, dumb and full of cum
Your father wasn't a glass maker
Your goose is cooked

Zigged when he should have zagged
Zip it!
Zip your lip
